# Python and Beer - InterIUT 2019

## Informations

This challenge was made for **InterIUT 2019**.

This CTF is for french two-year university students.
The goal was to have a gradual difficulty so they can learn how python works.

The last part is highly inspired by Martin Dube's pyjail on RingZer0 CTF.


There is no WriteUp for the moment so you can do your own one.
